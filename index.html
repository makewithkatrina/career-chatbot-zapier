Hey there! I'm Katrina. 👋🏾

I'm a strategic systems thinker with 12 years of experience translating executive priorities into organizational transformation and scalable systems that drive growth and operational excellence across tech, education, and SaaS sectors. I bring play to just enough process and thrive at the intersection of operations, creativity, and enablement.

When I first came across Emily Mabie on LinkedIn and her role as \"Senior AI Automation Engineer for HR,\" I thought, that's exactly the kind of work I already do and would love continuing. That could be me either as an AI Transformation Partner or, if I had to give myself a title, as a \"Senior AI Program Manager\" or \"Senior AI Business Strategist.\"\n\nBeyond my love for bringing play to just enough process and passion for \"figuring things out\", I am committed to understanding what's not working so I can tinker, build, deploy joyful solutions that work and teach others how they can do the same.

I held two separate hour-and-a-half working sessions with one member from each cross-functional team, where I ran a \"5 Whys\" session. I challenged all of us to examine our biases and focus on the true root causes.\n\nUsing the MoSCoW model, I created a priority roadmap that got 100% executive approval because everyone could finally see how their piece fit into the bigger picture.\n\nWe accelerated that 2+ year project to completion in 3 months. All critical initiatives moved to production as of December 2025. Similar to what Wade mentioned during ZapConnect 2025 with a \"This sucks and...\" discussion, I used this project to illustrate what sucked and how exactly we could tackle the issues."

That was all the information I was provided.\n\nThe photographer needed a shot list 2 weeks in advance and spent 30 minutes per concept. With 8 hours on-site, I needed to account for how many themed shots we could realistically take.\n\nAfter collaborating with our Recruitment Marketing lead, I presented six core shot concepts with my reasoning and pros/cons. I provided my manager with a clear sequence of actions: review the shot list by a specific deadline. If no feedback, we'd prioritize what I outlined but buffer 10 minutes per theme for variety.\n\nMy manager appreciated me making it easy for them to take action—a simple go-ahead or \"zero in on this\" while getting alignment from all teams.\n\nThe best part was getting different employee groups to participate that truly reflected our \"Twilio Magic\" culture."

While some people used the form, it seemed most people were still giving kudos in Slack. To me, it was obvious that having to do an extra step, (filling in the form) was still the barrier to giving meaningful kudos because it was faster to just do it in Slack.\n\nSo I decided to meet people where they are.\n\nI asked my boss, \"What if there was a way to automatically capture kudos by simply saying a magic word in Slack? That word being 'kudos.'\" He was interested, so I did a test run.\n\nI first defined the trigger and desired outcome:\n• Trigger: When someone mentions the word \"kudos\" in a specific Slack channel (New Mention)\n• Outcome: Send a copy of that kudos to Airtable (Create a New Record)\n\nThen I mapped the data flow:\nSlack message → Zapier catches it → Extracts key info (who, what, when) → Sends to Airtable\n\nThen I built and tested it:\n• Created a locked Slack channel\n• Tested with case-sensitive and case-insensitive mentions (Kudos, kudos)\n• Adjusted whether I wanted to pull out more or less information\n\nOnce my test proved successful, I moved toward documentation and enablement:\n• Drafted a simple guide for the team\n• Set up a feedback channel for improvements and iterations\n\nThe result was that twice as many people were giving kudos as before, and we now had a dedicated channel just for kudos (versus kudos getting lost in our primary announcements channel)."

I decided I could build something even better with zero additional dollars in Airtable.\n\nI wanted this to feel new and fresh. Since we were already paying for Airtable, I wanted to demonstrate how we could make the most of what we have with creativity.\n\nI designed a minimum lovable product: an Airtable form that fed into a base automatically. I added a dropdown of our company values employees had to select to give kudos more depth.\n\nI showcased how I'd elevated a static form with a searchable database. By tying kudos to a value in a dashboard, I gave leaders visibility into team contributions while giving employees a place to track accomplishments.\n\nLeadership actively encouraged people to use the new \"Kudos Board\" to celebrate achievements.\n\nTo me, limited resources mean \"being scrappy, not crappy\" to build something intuitive and delightful."

We often downplay our accomplishments, so being able to visibly see the impact that peers and managers recognize is something I hope people celebrate as they think about their growth.\n\n**Personally:** My travel blog, <a href='https://seekwanderful.com' target='_blank' style='color: #059669; text-decoration: underline;'>seekwanderful.com</a>. It's a testament to my commitment to personal excellence and a labor of love. Teaching myself WordPress, learning SEO, installing themes, setting up a domain and hosting, and writing all articles and editing all photos on my own—it's my art form and stories I'm excited to share.

But I'm at a point where I'm ready for a new challenge rooted in AI innovation and enablement.\n\nI'm looking for a role where I can bring my strategic systems thinking and \"figure it out\" energy to a company that's pushing boundaries, and I see that at Zapier.\n\nAs an anime enjoyer, I recently completed Love Through A Prism, and one of the challenges the art professor gives his students has a theme of \"free\" with the task of exploring the concept of being \"free\" through art. Zapier's culture and approach to the future of work and automation align with my interpretation of the concept of free, which is having the freedom to be creative and different in the work that you do, to try and fail to become better, and to create meaningful, impactful, and delightful experiences while having fun doing so.\n\nFrom Zapier's first public all-hands, to the several learning sessions Zapier has held, to ping pong with Wade (yes, I was there at the event) to show how leaders are on the ground building with their employees, to Zapier driving 97% AI adoption, it's clear to me that Zapier embodies not just curiosity around how to make AI for everyone but is writing the playbook to help bring other companies and enthusiasts along on the journey, moving past curiosity to enthusiastic adoption for all.\n\nI've always loved blending art with technology, and I can't imagine a better place to contribute my enthusiasm and expertise while also growing in my own craft."

I accelerated Stanford Online's stalled transformation from 2+ years to 3 months with 100% executive alignment.\n\n**The \"Why the hell are we doing it this way?\" mindset:** I'm not satisfied until I've done my due diligence.

The new user had visual impairment issues—ripples on buttons and pulsing pointers triggered their vertigo.\n\nThe fail? While the tool won for AI features, I was caught up in them and didn't consider accessibility beyond auditory processing. After their feedback, I removed all animations. That small change allowed them to review successfully and they applauded how easy I made the training.\n\nGreat reminder: create a checklist for considerations and consult specialists like instructional designers before getting started.

I illustrated how it reduced compliance risks (legal spoke to this) and showed hiring managers how better templates would reduce back-and-forth with recruiters and prevent candidates from self-selecting out of key roles.\n\nBreaking down ownership, highlighting benefits, and leveraging legal as an advocate gave hiring managers a stronger sense of responsibility by speaking in a language they understood, driving successful adoption."

I mentioned I could still manage the logistics and participant information, but if someone could carry out two specific tasks every month with the instructions I provided, it would help alleviate some of the workload and allow me to do my day-to-day more effectively.\n\nI built out a schedule that showed for the remainder of the year, each chair would only have to assist once every 2 months, alleviating the pressure that this would be an administrative burden, and making it feel more like a fun activity each person could own and put their own spin on if they desired."

Then I went into the demo environment to test creating accounts, opportunities, and prototyping flows.

Leads got buried and missed, causing team leads to clutter the inbox with questions.\n\nI built a zero-cost CRM in Airtable with automation. If an email hit our inbox, Airtable would extrapolate details and populate a table. A separate automation emailed the team if a lead wasn't contacted in 24 hours.\n\nThis created a searchable CRM where colleagues could assign themselves and see who required action. It significantly reduced lost leads and eliminated inbox replies.\n\nBy showing a preview and how we reduced two steps to one, others got curious, leading to more Airtable adoption and reduced email fatigue.\n\nWhen people realize how simple a new process can be, they're less skeptical."

Understand the pain:\n• What info are people searching for repeatedly?\n• Where do knowledge gaps cause friction?\n\n2. Design the taxonomy:\n• \"Keep it simple, stupid\"—use language the team knows, focus on core themes without overwhelming\n\n3. Build governance from day one:\n• Who owns updates? What's the review cadence?\n• How do we sunset outdated info?\n• Automate data integrity (dropdowns vs write-ins, identify duplications)\n\n4. Make it intuitive:\n• Different interfaces for different user types\n• Easy-to-read guides and visual hierarchy\n\nI created a robust, searchable knowledge base.
